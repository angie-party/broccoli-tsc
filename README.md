# broccoli-tsc
TypeScript preprocessor for Broccoli

![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/angie-party/broccoli-tsc.svg)

## Why

Because currently there is only [shinnn/broccoli-typescript](https://github.com/shinnn/broccoli-typescript) which is based on one year old [jedmao/typescript-api](https://github.com/jedmao/typescript-api) which obviously doesn't support TypeScript 1.5.

## Usage

See example [Brocfile.js](Brocfile.js)

## Test

```bash
$ npm install
$ make test
```

## Build

```bash
$ make
```
